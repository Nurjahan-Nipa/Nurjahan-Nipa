## <h2 align="left"> Hi, I'm Nurjahan Nipa! 👋 and I'm a research enthusiastic from Bangladesh.</h2>
###

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I am a passionate researcher, educator and data enthusiast currently pursuing advanced studies in computer science. I thrive at the intersection of technology and problem-solving, with a keen interest in big data, machine learning, and data science. 

I am currently pursuing my Ph.D. in the Division of Computer Science and Engineering at Louisiana State University (LSU), United States, beginning in January 2024. Alongside my doctoral studies, she is on study leave while serving as an Assistant Professor in the Department of IoT and Robotics Engineering (IRE) at Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman Digital University, Bangladesh (BDU), a role she has held since December 27, 2023.

Prior to this current role, I served as a Lecturer in the same department at BDU beginning June 13, 2019, and previously, in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at Gono Bishwabidyalay. She completed her B.Sc. (Hons) and M.Sc. degrees in Information Technology from the Institute of Information Technology (IIT), Jahangirnagar University, in 2015 and 2016, respectively.
